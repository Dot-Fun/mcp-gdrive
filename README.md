# Google Drive server

This MCP server integrates with Google Drive to allow listing, reading, and searching files, as well as the ability to read and write to Google Sheets.

This project includes code originally developed by Anthropic, PBC, licensed under the MIT License from [this repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/gdrive).

### Resources

The server provides access to Google Drive files:

- **Files** (`gdrive:///<file_id>`)
  - Supports all file types
  - Google Workspace files are automatically exported:
    - Docs â†’ Markdown
    - Sheets â†’ CSV
    - Presentations â†’ Plain text
    - Drawings â†’ PNG
  - Other files are provided in their native format

## Getting started

1. [Create a new Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2. [Enable the Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/workspace-api/products)
3. [Configure an OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) ("internal" is fine for testing)
4. Add OAuth scopes `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`, `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`
5. In order to allow interaction with sheets and docs you will also need to enable the [Google Sheets API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/sheets.googleapis.com/) and [Google Docs API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/docs.googleapis.com) in your workspaces Enabled API and Services section.
6. [Create an OAuth Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) for application type "Desktop App"
7. Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys
8. Note your OAuth Client ID and Client Secret from the downloaded file

### Setting up environment variables

You'll need to provide your OAuth credentials as environment variables. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Using a .env file (for development)
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```
GDRIVE_CREDS_DIR=/path/to/store/credentials
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
```

#### Option 2: Pass them directly in your MCP configuration (see Usage section below)

Make sure to build the server with either `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.

### Authentication

Next you will need to run `node ./dist/index.js` to trigger the authentication step

You will be prompted to authenticate with your browser. You must authenticate with an account in the same organization as your Google Cloud project.

Your OAuth token is saved in the directory specified by the `GDRIVE_CREDS_DIR` environment variable.

### Usage with Claude Desktop App

To use this MCP server with Claude Desktop, add the following to your Claude configuration file:

**On macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**On Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-gdrive/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
        "GDRIVE_CREDS_DIR": "/path/to/store/auth/tokens"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to:
1. Clone this repository and run `npm install && npm run build`
2. Use absolute paths in your configuration
3. Replace `<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>` and `<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>` with your actual credentials
